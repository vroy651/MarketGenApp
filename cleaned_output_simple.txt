The surge in prices of goods and services is driving individuals and households to cut back on spending. The cost of living crisis is not a uniquely Kenyan phenomenon but is happening everywhere in the world even in the developed economies. | For the manufacturing sector, this decline in consumer spending means reduced production to curb excess inventory and manage escalating costs of production, resulting in loss of jobs and revenue for companies. Such a scenario dictates that manufacturers engage survival gear through cost reduction while devising strategies to sustain consumer confidence in order to remain afloat in such a hostile economic environment. | According to the Cambridge Dictionary, consumer confidence is the degree to which people feel confident about how well the economy is doing, which influences how much money they are willing to spend. This implies a direct correlation between the state of the economy and level of consumer spending. A consumer confidence index is a tool used to gauge how much people are spending on goods and services vis--vis the prevailing market conditions. | For example, the Ipsos consumer confidence index this month is at 47.2 per cent compared to about 50 per cent in 2018 signifying a general fall in optimism in countries around the world. The survey covered 29,000 adults in 29 markets and was conducted online. Closer home, a similar survey by Kasi Insights in Cote dIvoire, Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania, shows a slump in consumer sentiment early this year. | With the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warning of an economic recession, things can only get tougher for manufacturers. A report by Deloitte shows manufacturing declines by about 11 per cent during recessions. On the flip side, the manufacturing sector is among the fastest to rebound after an economic downturn. The resilience of the sector is down to certain dynamics around consumer behavior. | With the economic situation of many households deteriorating due to expenditure exceeding disposable income, more consumers are switching from higher-end or larger products to lower-priced, smaller units in order to survive. This phenomenon is known as downtrading and occurs when the purchasing power of consumers is under pressure. | For manufacturers, this presents an opportunity to offer consumers quality products at the desired quantity and price point. Downtrading does not necessarily mean the buyer is willing to compromise on quality. It simply means they are seeking more affordable options to sustain their current lifestyle while spending less. Transitioning to budget-friendly products is not new in Kenya, with the kadogo economy having been around for many years. This is where individuals purchase a smaller unit of a brand at a price that suits their pocket. They still enjoy the same quality notwithstanding quantity and price differential. | This is how many consumer brands have been able to attract and retain a loyal clientele even in the lower income bracket. Analysis by market research firm Nielsen in 2018, reported that more than 70 per cent of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) in Kenya are priced below Ksh 55. Interestingly, the same research discovered that much as consumers are increasingly price conscious, they are also looking for value and are willing to pay more for quality products. | Quality is everything. As Henry Royce, co-founder of the famous Rolls Royce automaker, said, the quality will remain long after the price is forgotten. This means a business cannot afford to compromise on quality regardless of the price it sells its products. And quality goes beyond complying with set technical standards and product specifications, but crucially, meeting and surpassing customer expectations. | The sweet spot where consumer expectations meet price is quality hence the need for manufacturers to continue paying attention to quality and innovation in spite of the challenging economic times. This sounds counter-intuitive but is the only way of sustaining operations against weaker consumer demand and ensuring quicker industrial recovery once the current unfavorable conditions subside. Moreover, quality products also safeguard consumer health and wellbeing. | Mr. Malde is Commercial Director, Pwani Oil Products Limited.

Pwani | Share: | More Posts | Sawa Soap, Pwani Oils Family Bathing Soap, partnered with the Ministry of Education and Schools to educate 15,024 Students on Good Hygiene and importance of Handwashing. | Over 4,500 Household Cleaners to Gain Skills, Cleaning Tools in New Ushindi, Mama Fua Campaign | Pwani Oil Launches Year-Round Environmental Conservation Campaign | MOMBASA, KENYA, JULY 27, 2023 Leading edible oils and detergent manufacturer Pwani Oil has announced a significant investment in an ultra-modern liquid detergent plant, the first of its kind in the East Africa Region. | Located inside the Kikambala factory, the plant is an addition to the edible oils and soap plant and is part of Pwani Oils commitment to proactively meet the ever-evolving needs and preferences of Kenyan consumers. | As a liquid detergent plant, the additional establishment will focus on manufacturing an extensive range of home and personal care products, a diversification move away from Pwani Oils renowned oil-based products. This will include an array of innovative solutions such as dishwashers, floor pastes, fabric softeners, milking jelly, shower gels, hand and body wash, shampoo, conditioners, and body lotions, among others. | Speaking at the new plant, Pwani Oil Commercial Director Rajul Malde said, With this expansion, we are not only diversifying our product offerings but also demonstrating our commitment to safety, sustainability, and innovation. We are excited to bring these high-quality, environmentally friendly products to Kenyan households and contribute to a greener future. | The liquid detergent plant boasts an impressive production capacity, enabling the manufacture of 40 tonnes of dishwashing pastes, dishwashing liquid, and floor cleaners daily. Additionally, it will produce 12 tonnes of personal care products per day, encompassing milking jelly, petroleum jelly, lotions, creams, and an assortment of soaps. These high-quality products are expected to have a shelf life exceeding 2.5 years, ensuring long-lasting freshness and effectiveness. | With a vision for growth and a commitment to innovation, Pwani Oil anticipates that this new investment will contribute more than 20 per cent of its overall business by the year 2032. | Pwani Oils decision to expand into the liquid detergent market was driven by extensive consumer research, which identified a gap in the industry for products that offer enhanced freshness and additional features. The company responded to this demand by developing floor cleaners that repel insects, providing consumers with an added benefit to their cleaning routines. | On Safety and environmental responsibility, the plant is designed to be environmentally sustainable and adheres to stringent manufacturing standards as this was a central consideration in its establishment. It complies with Home Care and Food Care regulations, ensuring the highest level of safety for consumers. | We have implemented rigorous quality control measures throughout the manufacturing process, ensuring that the products remain uncontaminated by bacteria. The entire production process is automated, eliminating the risk of human contact. Said Malde. | In addition, Sustainability is at the forefront of the plants and the entire Pwani oil operations. The company has made substantial investments to minimize its environmental impact. The liquid detergent plant incorporates a water treatment facility, enabling water recycling and conservation. Rainwater harvesting, in conjunction with water purifiers, helps to replenish the plants water supply. | Moreover, Pwani Oil has demonstrated its commitment to renewable energy by installing solar power plants across the facility, generating 1.2 megawatts of solar power and 1.4 megawatts of steam turbine-generated power. These initiatives highlight Pwani Oils dedication to sustainable practices and its contribution to a greener future. | The inauguration of Pwani Oils liquid detergent plant and the introduction of its diverse range of home and personal care products represent a significant milestone for the company and the Kenyan market. | WhatsApp us https://pwani.net/cooking-oils/fresh-fri/#content | Cooking Oil  Fresh Fri  Pwani | Fresh Fri | Cooking Oil | Variants | Fresh Fri | Fresh Fri Ginger Oil | Fresh Fri Garlic | Product Features | Steps | Health Benefits | WhatsApp us https://pwani.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/portion-african-chapati-bean-stew-garlic-lemons-scaled.jpg | nan | nan https://pwani.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/korean-traditional-fried-noodles-with-chicken-vegetables-egg.jpg | nan | nan https://pwani.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/closeup-roasted-meat-with-sauce-vegetables-fries-plate-table-scaled.jpg | nan | nan https://pwani.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/baked-chicken-wings-asian-style-scaled.jpg | nan | nan https://pwani.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/side-view-doner-with-grilled-chicken-greens-lettuce-tomato-french-fries-table-scaled.jpg | nan | nan https://pwani.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/side-view-pilaf-with-stewed-beef-meat-plate-scaled.jpg | nan | nan https://pwani.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/spicy-minced-pork-rice-black-plate-scaled.jpg | nan | nan https://pwani.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tempting-biryani-with-fluffy-basmati-rice.jpg | nan | nan https://pwani.net/cooking-oils/salit/#content | Cooking Oil  Salit  Pwani | Salit | Cooking Oil | About | No Cholesterol | Triple Refined | Fortified with Vitamin A& D | Health Benefits | Salit is a triple refined vegetable oil for fresh crispy food.

The surge in prices of goods and services is driving individuals and households to cut back on spending. The cost of living crisis is not a uniquely Kenyan phenomenon but is happening everywhere in the world even in the developed economies. | For the manufacturing sector, this decline in consumer spending means reduced production to curb excess inventory and manage escalating costs of production, resulting in loss of jobs and revenue for companies. Such a scenario dictates that manufacturers engage survival gear through cost reduction while devising strategies to sustain consumer confidence in order to remain afloat in such a hostile economic environment. | According to the Cambridge Dictionary, consumer confidence is the degree to which people feel confident about how well the economy is doing, which influences how much money they are willing to spend. This implies a direct correlation between the state of the economy and level of consumer spending. A consumer confidence index is a tool used to gauge how much people are spending on goods and services vis--vis the prevailing market conditions. | For example, the Ipsos consumer confidence index this month is at 47.2 per cent compared to about 50 per cent in 2018 signifying a general fall in optimism in countries around the world. The survey covered 29,000 adults in 29 markets and was conducted online. Closer home, a similar survey by Kasi Insights in Cote dIvoire, Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania, shows a slump in consumer sentiment early this year. | With the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warning of an economic recession, things can only get tougher for manufacturers. A report by Deloitte shows manufacturing declines by about 11 per cent during recessions. On the flip side, the manufacturing sector is among the fastest to rebound after an economic downturn. The resilience of the sector is down to certain dynamics around consumer behavior. | With the economic situation of many households deteriorating due to expenditure exceeding disposable income, more consumers are switching from higher-end or larger products to lower-priced, smaller units in order to survive. This phenomenon is known as downtrading and occurs when the purchasing power of consumers is under pressure. | For manufacturers, this presents an opportunity to offer consumers quality products at the desired quantity and price point. Downtrading does not necessarily mean the buyer is willing to compromise on quality. It simply means they are seeking more affordable options to sustain their current lifestyle while spending less. Transitioning to budget-friendly products is not new in Kenya, with the kadogo economy having been around for many years. This is where individuals purchase a smaller unit of a brand at a price that suits their pocket. They still enjoy the same quality notwithstanding quantity and price differential. | This is how many consumer brands have been able to attract and retain a loyal clientele even in the lower income bracket. Analysis by market research firm Nielsen in 2018, reported that more than 70 per cent of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) in Kenya are priced below Ksh 55. Interestingly, the same research discovered that much as consumers are increasingly price conscious, they are also looking for value and are willing to pay more for quality products. | Quality is everything. As Henry Royce, co-founder of the famous Rolls Royce automaker, said, the quality will remain long after the price is forgotten. This means a business cannot afford to compromise on quality regardless of the price it sells its products. And quality goes beyond complying with set technical standards and product specifications, but crucially, meeting and surpassing customer expectations. | The sweet spot where consumer expectations meet price is quality hence the need for manufacturers to continue paying attention to quality and innovation in spite of the challenging economic times. This sounds counter-intuitive but is the only way of sustaining operations against weaker consumer demand and ensuring quicker industrial recovery once the current unfavorable conditions subside.

Today, the company handed over a substantial donation of Popco Pure Vegetable Oil and personal care items, including bars of Ndume Natural Bar Soap to assist at least 1,000 families that have been affected by the floods. | The region has experienced massive displacement, with families losing their homes and belongings.

Kenya, Isiolo County is particularly vulnerable to floods from neighboring Meru and Laikipia counties.

Innovation is one such strategy as it involves coming up, not only with new products, but also resilient business models to drive future business sustainability. | It sounds counter-intuitive to urge companies to innovate during tough economic times, considering innovation costs time, money and resources. However, various authoritative reports appear to suggest businesses that embrace a creative mindset during crisis tend to emerge stronger, more competitive and better equipped to harness future growth opportunities. | Given the current situation in Kenya and globally, innovation is evidently a strategic priority for manufacturers as they seek to counter the negative impact of the high cost of living on consumer spending, made worse by shrinking financial margins due to escalating cost of production. | To retain customers, cut costs and boost productivity, manufacturers are coming up with ingenious ways to make their products more attractive to consumers and grow revenue. Despite the tough economy, some are opting to invest in more efficient, state-of-the-art technology as they shift to innovation-led production. | Both consumers and manufacturers benefit from this approach. First, consumers get value for money by buying better quality, safer, more affordable and environmentally-friendly products, despite less spending power due to inflation. What this means, for example, is that I can purchase a detergent that cleans my dishes and clothes better, using less water and is softer on my skin, at the same or reduced price compared to the brand I have been using. | Second, innovation helps manufacturers build stronger relationships with consumers by addressing their personal desires and preferences. For instance, if I embrace healthy cooking as part of lifestyle changes, I should be able to get edible oil products that address that specific need on the supermarket shelves. | Third, investing in innovative technologies gives companies a competitive edge through reduced cost, enhanced efficiency and productivity. In this era of disruptive digital technology, industries are turning to artificial intelligence, robotics, Big Data and other modern industrial software applications to streamline and enhance processes. | Such inventive methods help businesses gain deeper insights into customers purchase and consumption behaviors thus helping improve products where necessary to address these unique traits. This also facilitates diversification targeting specific demographics and tastes. | It is for the foregoing reasons that local consumer manufacturing companies are now increasingly turning to innovation as a proven strategy for long-term growth even as the economy continues to struggle against the backdrop of a projected global recession. Leading by example, Pwani Oil has recently invested in a new factory plant to help diversify its product portfolio in addition to creating more jobs for Kenyans. | The new plant is designed to be environmentally sustainable and adheres to stringent manufacturing standards thus ensuring the highest level of safety for users. It is also designed to minimize environmental impact, for example, recycling water to reduce pressure on the water table. Rainwater harvesting in conjunction with water purifiers help to replenish supply to the plant. | Investing in research and development (R&D) is not only good for the company but society as a whole taking into account social benefits such as access by the public to quality, safe products and a cleaner environment. In a nutshell, manufacturing commitment to innovation must go hand-in-glove with dedication to safety and environmental responsibilities. | Mr. Malde is Commercial Director, Pwani Oil Products Limited | WhatsApp us https://pwani.net/leading-edible-oils-manufacturer-pwani-oil-has-announced-plans-to-transition-all-its-plants-machinery-to-rely-on-50-renewable-energy-sources-by-2030-this-is-even-as-it-aims-at-upgrading-its-e/#content | Pwani Oil Diversifies to Home and Personal Care Products, Invests in State-Of-The-Art Liquid Detergent Plant.

This will include an array of innovative solutions such as dishwashers, floor pastes, fabric softeners, milking jelly, shower gels, hand and body wash, shampoo, conditioners, and body lotions, among others. | Speaking at the new plant, Pwani Oil Commercial Director Rajul Malde said, With this expansion, we are not only diversifying our product offerings but also demonstrating our commitment to safety, sustainability, and innovation. We are excited to bring these high-quality, environmentally friendly products to Kenyan households and contribute to a greener future. | The liquid detergent plant boasts an impressive production capacity, enabling the manufacture of 40 tonnes of dishwashing pastes, dishwashing liquid, and floor cleaners daily. Additionally, it will produce 12 tonnes of personal care products per day, encompassing milking jelly, petroleum jelly, lotions, creams, and an assortment of soaps. These high-quality products are expected to have a shelf life exceeding 2.5 years, ensuring long-lasting freshness and effectiveness. | With a vision for growth and a commitment to innovation, Pwani Oil anticipates that this new investment will contribute more than 20 per cent of its overall business by the year 2032. | Pwani Oils decision to expand into the liquid detergent market was driven by extensive consumer research, which identified a gap in the industry for products that offer enhanced freshness and additional features. The company responded to this demand by developing floor cleaners that repel insects, providing consumers with an added benefit to their cleaning routines. | On Safety and environmental responsibility, the plant is designed to be environmentally sustainable and adheres to stringent manufacturing standards as this was a central consideration in its establishment. It complies with Home Care and Food Care regulations, ensuring the highest level of safety for consumers. | We have implemented rigorous quality control measures throughout the manufacturing process, ensuring that the products remain uncontaminated by bacteria. The entire production process is automated, eliminating the risk of human contact. Said Malde. | In addition, Sustainability is at the forefront of the plants and the entire Pwani oil operations. The company has made substantial investments to minimize its environmental impact. The liquid detergent plant incorporates a water treatment facility, enabling water recycling and conservation. Rainwater harvesting, in conjunction with water purifiers, helps to replenish the plants water supply. | Moreover, Pwani Oil has demonstrated its commitment to renewable energy by installing solar power plants across the facility, generating 1.2 megawatts of solar power and 1.4 megawatts of steam turbine-generated power. These initiatives highlight Pwani Oils dedication to sustainable practices and its contribution to a greener future. | The inauguration of Pwani Oils liquid detergent plant and the introduction of its diverse range of home and personal care products represent a significant milestone for the company and the Kenyan market. | WhatsApp us https://pwani.net/2023/07/27/ | July 27, 2023  Pwani | July 27, 2023 | Sawa Soap, Pwani Oils Family Bathing Soap, partnered with the Ministry of Education and Schools to educate 15,024 Students on Good Hygiene and importance of Handwashing. | Over 4,500 Household Cleaners to Gain Skills, Cleaning Tools in New Ushindi, Mama Fua Campaign | Pwani Oil Launches Year-Round Environmental Conservation Campaign | Pwani Oil Products Limited (Pwani Oil) organized and participated in the International Beach Clean Up Day in Kilifi County | Faith Wanyama from Busia County Crowned Miss Earth Kenya 2024 and the Official Brand Ambassador of Pwani Oils Afrisense Beauty Soap | 1,000 tree seedlings planted in Kilifi County through Pwani Oil initiative, 4,000 more set aside for rainy season | WhatsApp us https://pwani.net/pwani-oil-commits-to-sustainable-energy-practices-aims-to-power-plants-machinery-with-50-renewable-energy-by-2030/ | Pwani Oil Commits to Sustainable Energy Practices  Pwani | Share: | More Posts | Sawa Soap, Pwani Oils Family Bathing Soap, partnered with the Ministry of Education and Schools to educate 15,024 Students on Good Hygiene and importance of Handwashing. | Over 4,500 Household Cleaners to Gain Skills, Cleaning Tools in New Ushindi, Mama Fua Campaign | Pwani Oil Launches Year-Round Environmental Conservation Campaign | Mombasa, Kenya, June 9th, 2023Leading edible oils manufacturer Pwani Oil has announced plans to transition all its Plants & Machinery to rely on 50% renewable energy sources by 2030. | This is even as it aims at upgrading its existing power plant to generate more power internally by the end of this year. | The move highlights the companys unwavering dedication to energy efficiency and aligns with its broader sustainability agenda aimed at combating climate change. | Commenting on the move, Pwani Oil Commercial Director Rajul Malde said, Recognizing the urgent need to address environmental challenges, we are steadfast in our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint. In this regard, we are on a roll to implement energy-saving policies and drive a culture of innovation to reduce energy consumption by 30% per unit of production by 2030. This ambitious target will not only contribute to mitigating climate change but in improving operational efficiency. | In its mission to promote biodiversity and combat deforestation, Pwani Oil has also kicked off a tree planting exercise aimed at growing 1 million trees as part of its comprehensive plan to increase Carbon storage. By actively participating in reforestation efforts, the company aims to counterbalance its environmental impact and restore crucial ecosystems for the benefit of future generations. | Besides, the company is dedicated to continuously implementing alternative and sustainable fuel sources such as briquettes, cashew nut shells, Macadamia seeds, and Maize cobs, thus minimizing its ecological footprint and contributing to the preservation of natural resources. | In addition, Pwani Oil intends to achieve a 50% Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification for all palm oil and palm derivatives to solidify its commitment to sustainable palm oil production. This certification underscores the companys dedication to responsible sourcing and supports the sustainable growth of the palm oil industry, which plays a crucial role in various sectors. | Recently, Pwani Oils dedication to sustainability and energy efficiency was acknowledged as the company received the first runner Award from the Energy Management Award in Electricity Savings Award- LC (45,000G), reinforcing its commitment to driving positive change within the industry and inspires the company to continue its relentless pursuit of energy efficiency and sustainability. | As Pwani Oil forges ahead in its sustainable energy journey, we remain committed to fostering a greener future and serving as a role model for others in the industry.

What this means, for example, is that I can purchase a detergent that cleans my dishes and clothes better, using less water and is softer on my skin, at the same or reduced price compared to the brand I have been using. | Second, innovation helps manufacturers build stronger relationships with consumers by addressing their personal desires and preferences. For instance, if I embrace healthy cooking as part of lifestyle changes, I should be able to get edible oil products that address that specific need on the supermarket shelves. | Third, investing in innovative technologies gives companies a competitive edge through reduced cost, enhanced efficiency and productivity. In this era of disruptive digital technology, industries are turning to artificial intelligence, robotics, Big Data and other modern industrial software applications to streamline and enhance processes. | Such inventive methods help businesses gain deeper insights into customers purchase and consumption behaviors thus helping improve products where necessary to address these unique traits. This also facilitates diversification targeting specific demographics and tastes. | It is for the foregoing reasons that local consumer manufacturing companies are now increasingly turning to innovation as a proven strategy for long-term growth even as the economy continues to struggle against the backdrop of a projected global recession. Leading by example, Pwani Oil has recently invested in a new factory plant to help diversify its product portfolio in addition to creating more jobs for Kenyans. | The new plant is designed to be environmentally sustainable and adheres to stringent manufacturing standards thus ensuring the highest level of safety for users. It is also designed to minimize environmental impact, for example, recycling water to reduce pressure on the water table. Rainwater harvesting in conjunction with water purifiers help to replenish supply to the plant. | Investing in research and development (R&D) is not only good for the company but society as a whole taking into account social benefits such as access by the public to quality, safe products and a cleaner environment. In a nutshell, manufacturing commitment to innovation must go hand-in-glove with dedication to safety and environmental responsibilities. | Mr. Malde is Commercial Director, Pwani Oil Products Limited | WhatsApp us https://pwani.net/2023/09/21/ | September 21, 2023  Pwani | September 21, 2023 | Sawa Soap, Pwani Oils Family Bathing Soap, partnered with the Ministry of Education and Schools to educate 15,024 Students on Good Hygiene and importance of Handwashing. | Over 4,500 Household Cleaners to Gain Skills, Cleaning Tools in New Ushindi, Mama Fua Campaign | Pwani Oil Launches Year-Round Environmental Conservation Campaign | Pwani Oil Products Limited (Pwani Oil) organized and participated in the International Beach Clean Up Day in Kilifi County | Faith Wanyama from Busia County Crowned Miss Earth Kenya 2024 and the Official Brand Ambassador of Pwani Oils Afrisense Beauty Soap | 1,000 tree seedlings planted in Kilifi County through Pwani Oil initiative, 4,000 more set aside for rainy season | WhatsApp us https://pwani.net/2023/07/27/#content | July 27, 2023  Pwani | July 27, 2023 | Sawa Soap, Pwani Oils Family Bathing Soap, partnered with the Ministry of Education and Schools to educate 15,024 Students on Good Hygiene and importance of Handwashing. | Over 4,500 Household Cleaners to Gain Skills, Cleaning Tools in New Ushindi, Mama Fua Campaign | Pwani Oil Launches Year-Round Environmental Conservation Campaign | Pwani Oil Products Limited (Pwani Oil) organized and participated in the International Beach Clean Up Day in Kilifi County | Faith Wanyama from Busia County Crowned Miss Earth Kenya 2024 and the Official Brand Ambassador of Pwani Oils Afrisense Beauty Soap | 1,000 tree seedlings planted in Kilifi County through Pwani Oil initiative, 4,000 more set aside for rainy season | WhatsApp us https://pwani.net/pwani-oil-commits-to-sustainable-energy-practices-aims-to-power-plants-machinery-with-50-renewable-energy-by-2030/#content | Pwani Oil Commits to Sustainable Energy Practices  Pwani | Share: | More Posts | Sawa Soap, Pwani Oils Family Bathing Soap, partnered with the Ministry of Education and Schools to educate 15,024 Students on Good Hygiene and importance of Handwashing. | Over 4,500 Household Cleaners to Gain Skills, Cleaning Tools in New Ushindi, Mama Fua Campaign | Pwani Oil Launches Year-Round Environmental Conservation Campaign | Mombasa, Kenya, June 9th, 2023Leading edible oils manufacturer Pwani Oil has announced plans to transition all its Plants & Machinery to rely on 50% renewable energy sources by 2030. | This is even as it aims at upgrading its existing power plant to generate more power internally by the end of this year. | The move highlights the companys unwavering dedication to energy efficiency and aligns with its broader sustainability agenda aimed at combating climate change. | Commenting on the move, Pwani Oil Commercial Director Rajul Malde said, Recognizing the urgent need to address environmental challenges, we are steadfast in our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint.

Through our innovative practices and ambitious goals, we hope to set an example for companies worldwide, demonstrating that sustainable energy solutions are not only essential but also economically viable.
